# Sensors

Computers (and brains) work with voltages. In order for a computer to understand signals in the environment (light, sound, pressure, temperature, etc.), then these signals must be converted into a voltage. This conversion is called transduction and the thing that does it is a transducer. However, for our purposes, we will call these transduction devices *sensors*.

## Measuring Heat

Heat is the average kinetic energy of a material. The temperature of a resistor changes its resistance. We can convert this change in resistance to a change in voltage using a voltage divider.
