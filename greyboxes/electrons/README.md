# Electrons

Electrons are sub-atomic particles with a negative electric charge. Their negative charge produces and electric field that attracts positive charges and repels negative charges.

In this box, we will learn about electricity...how to measure and control it.

## Conductors and Resistance

Electrons are normally tightly bound to their atomic nucleus (which contains positively charged protons and neutral neutrons). However, for some atoms, the outermost shell of electrons is very weakly bound and these outer electrons are free to move from one atom to another. These materials are conductors, because they can conduct a flow of electrons...electricity.

- What is resistance (and conductivity)? Ohms and Siemens.
