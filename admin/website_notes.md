# website notes

1. static sight
- take the boxes and intro materials and compile to a single github pages static site
- for each box, add a link to the next and previous boxes to the HTML footer
- add an intro page for the course (rip from REPO Readme?)

2. local server site
- setup run the server locally, store the data locally
- django? would have to explain a lot of this...

3. dynamic site
- django or similar + apache webserver or similar
