## issues
- AV issues in the auditorium
- fuses blown in little multimeters
- misunderstanding measuring current vs. voltage

## ideas
- history on each slide
- making a basic speaker is possible?
	- maybe by building an oscillator?

Box flow ideas:

- Split amplifiers into semiconductors + amplifiers
  - Seminconductors covers diodes and transistors
  - Amplifiers covers feedback, constant current source, and Op Amps

- Decisions: basic comparator (with multi-level thresholds) with Schmitt-Trigger as challenge

- Logic (comes before data): Use transistors to build logic gates, do some BOOL

- Data: Use logic to build 2-bit ADC for 4-level comparator

- Computation: Build simple adder (think about multiplation, subtration)

- Memory: Build a NAND based SR-Latch and maybe a D-Flip-Flop

- Time: (Clocks?) - new box? (should it be earlier?)

- Computers: (still needs to be discussed, ALU, registers, bus (tri-state buffers), memory adresses)
