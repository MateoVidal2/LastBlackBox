# The Last Black Box Neuronauts: Day 1 - Electrons to Transistors

## Topics

- Atoms (protons, neutrons, and electrons)
- Charge (+ and -)
- Electric fields
- Voltage (differences in charge density): V
- Batteries (producing voltages)
- *Task:* Meausre voltage of AA battery
- Conductors (distal orbital electrons in some materials, free to move between nuclei)
- Resistors (mixes of materials): R
- *Task*: Measure mystery resistor
- Current (how many charges per second): I
- Circuits (diagrams and symbols)
- *Task*: Measure Ohm's Law (How to measure current? Draw circuit diagram)
- Ohm's Law: V = IR (linear IV curve)
- *Task*: Voltage divider with dicrete resistors and potentionmeter
- ***break***
- Semi-conductors (silicon cyrstal, doping with charge carriers)
- PN junction (concentration gradient turns into electrical potential at equilibrium)
- Diodes (push against electrical gradient, forward bias...against, reverse bias...nonlinear IV curve
- Transistors (PNP, NPN...channel...small signals control big signals...amplification and switches!)
- *Goal*: **An Analog Robot**
- *Task*: Assemble prototyping board on robot chasis
- *Task*: Measure the threshold of a Transistor
- *Play*: Buzzer and LEDs
- *Challenge*: Esaki Oscillator
