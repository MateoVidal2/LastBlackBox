# The Last Black Box Bootcamp: Day 4 - Machine Vision

## Morning

----

### NB3 Build (forebrain)

- Watch this video: [NB3 Forebrain](https://vimeo.com/628545232)
- *Task 1a*: Mount a camera and a "cortex" on your robot
- *Task 1b*: Enable the camera
- *Task 2*: Take a first photo and video
- *Task 3*: Transfer photo and video to your computer
- *Task 4*: Live stream camera feed
- *Task 5*: Image processing using Python

### Machine Vision

- Watch the long video and the Jupyter notebook video [ENB Machine Vision](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IFq9GW5x4-vth9P_7aa9M0LPKJwn1hfv?usp=sharing)
- *Task 2*: Take a first photo and video
- *Task 3*: Transfer photo and video to your computer

## Afternoon

----

### Machine Vision

- Live Lecture: "Classic Machine Vision principles"
- *Task 1*: Incorporate face detection algorithm
- *Task 2*: Save images from your face (> 100)
- *Task 3*: Let the robot react. If the robot identifies a face, let it do cool stuff
- *Task 4*: Resizing images - each face image should have the same resolution (128, 128, 3)

### Pro tasks

Depending on your progress, you can tackle the following tasks:

- *Pro task 1*: Incorporate background subtraction to your live stream
- *Pro task 2*: Threshold the background subtracted frame
- *Pro task 3*: Find the center of mass of your thresholded image
