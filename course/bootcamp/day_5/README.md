# The Last Black Box Bootcamp: Day 5 - Machine Vision

## Morning

----

### NB3 Build (forebrain)

- Watch this video: [NB3 Forebrain](https://vimeo.com/628545232)
  - *Note*: We do ***NOT*** have the Google Coral NPU this year (they cannot accelerate the modern "Transformer" networks and have become very difficult to supply).   
  - *However*: we do have new cameras (with auto-focus). These require a slight tweak to the mounting strategy shown in the video, see suggestion below.

- *Task 1a*: Mount a camera and a "cortex" on your robot
- *Task 1b*: Enable the camera
- *Task 2*: Take a first photo and video
- *Task 3*: Transfer photo and video to your computer
- *Task 4*: Live stream camera feed
- *Task 5*: Image processing using Python

### Machine Vision

- Watch the long video and the Jupyter notebook video [ENB Machine Vision](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IFq9GW5x4-vth9P_7aa9M0LPKJwn1hfv?usp=sharing)
- *Task 2*: Take a first photo and video
- *Task 3*: Transfer photo and video to your computer
- *Task 4*: Live stream camera feed
- *Task 5*: Image processing using Python

More information on the tasks are found in a [separate document](Morning.md)

## Afternoon

### Machine Vision

- Live Lecture: "Classic Machine Vision principles"
- *Task 1*: Incorporate face detection algorithm
- *Task 2*: Find the vector from image center to the face(s)
- *Task 3*: Let the robot react. If the robot identifies a face, let it do cool stuff
- *Task 4*: Be creative, what can you do?

### Pro tasks

Depending on your progress, you can tackle the following tasks:

- *Pro task 1*: Incorporate background subtraction to your live stream
- *Pro task 2*: Threshold the background subtracted frame
